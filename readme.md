Camera Adapter for USB3Vision cameras in Micro-Manager 1.4.xx, 32-bit only.

This adapter is based on the GigECamera adapter which interfaces with the JAI vision SDK. The GigECamera adapter only works with JAI SDK 1.4.1. However, the newer JAI SDK 2.1.6 can also interface with USB3Vision cameras, in addition to GigEVision cameras.

This has been tested only with a USB3Vision camera from Point Grey.
